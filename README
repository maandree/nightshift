NAME
	nightshift - A terminal user interface for redshift

SYNOPSIS
	nightshift [OPTIONS]... [\{ [SCRIPT-OPTIONS]... \}] [-- [REDSHIFT-OPTIONS]...]

DESCRIPTION
	Terminal user interface for redshift, a program for
	setting the colour temperature of the display according
	to the time of day.

	The goal of this project is to provide high capabilities
	to redshift when it becomes a D-Bus services, and do so
	with a nice terminal user interface and a command line
	interface with a daemon running in the background.
